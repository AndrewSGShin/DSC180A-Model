## DSC180A-Model

#### Guidelines for Running the Code:
* Build the Image using the Dockerfile (or refer to my DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/shindru/modelimage).
* Make sure to place all captures (or CSV's) needed for testing in the same directory as the .py file.
* Run the following command: 'python model.py [csv]', where [csv]=input file's name.
* The code should output a string with an array containing the input's predicted classification.
